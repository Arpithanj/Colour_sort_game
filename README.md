 ColorSortingGame üéÆ
A fun and interactive color sorting game built using Python and OpenCV.

This project simulates a simple game where users sort colored objects (like balls or shapes) into their correct places. It uses computer vision techniques and basic image processing with OpenCV to detect colors, track object movements, and provide a visually engaging gameplay experience.

üîß Features:
Color detection and tracking using OpenCV

Interactive sorting of colored objects

Real-time visuals with OpenCV window

Basic logic for win/lose or level completion (if implemented)

Great for learning computer vision and image processing

üß† Technologies Used:
Language: Python

Library: OpenCV (cv2)

Concepts: Color detection, contour finding, drawing shapes, real-time video processing

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run:
Clone the repository

Make sure you have Python and OpenCV installed

bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python
Run the script:

bash
Copy code
