This project is a visually engaging puzzle game where the player must sort colored elements (like balls or blocks) into their respective containers. The game is built using Pygame, and it demonstrates logic-building, game design, and graphical user interface development in Python.

🔧 Features:
Interactive drag-and-drop color sorting

Smooth and colorful animations

Randomized level setup using Python’s random module

Logical gameplay to challenge the user’s thinking

Built-in reset and win condition logic

Uses deep copy logic for game state management

🧠 Technologies Used:
Language: Python

Libraries:

pygame – for graphics and user interaction

random – for generating random game states

copy – for managing deep copies of game objects

▶️ How to Run:
Clone the repository

Make sure Python is installed

Install Pygame if not already installed:

bash
Copy code
pip install pygame
Run the game:

bash
Copy code
python color_sorting_game.py
💡 Game Objective:
Sort all the colors into their respective containers so that each container holds only one color. The fewer moves you make, the better your performance!
